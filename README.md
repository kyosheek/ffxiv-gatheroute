## The Idea

In my sprout days I have been crafting all available items and came up with my own spreadsheet for any materials I needed for crafting. The work of always checking for spreadsheet even in sorted and filtered format seemed tedious â€“ I have all the data, just tell me where to go and what to do! So I came up with the idea of this simple app that will help to improve gathering experience.

## How to Use

Go to [https://www.ffxiv-gatheroute.xyz/](https://www.ffxiv-gatheroute.xyz/). One the left side there is a dropdown with some materials. Select one of it and enter desired quantity. The item entry will appear in the list below. Repeat as needed for other items (you can also edit quantity of desired item by selecting it in dropdown again). When you are done, click _"Get Route"_ button. Now the app will build optimal route for you and guide you step-by-step. Follow the instructions and _catch 'em all_! If you need to remove some items, click the _x_ in the item card. If you want to add new items, just add them as usual. 

>_Note: for now after adding/removing items from the list, you need to manually regenerate a route by pressing "Get Route" button again._

## Roadmap
The roadmap is written in another `.md` file! Here is a [link](ROADMAP.md). It has some small tweaks to apply from my side for now, but I am sure more things will be added with based on community suggestions!
